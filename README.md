# IOT Based Gas Leakage Detector

LPG (Liquid Petroleum Gas) is use almost in every house for cooking purpose. This gas is highly inflammable and need to be careful while using it. There are situations where accidents have occurred and huge damage has been seen. In this project we will build a LPG gas detection system using MQ4 Sensor. The project NodeMCU ESP8266 IoT based LPG Gas Leakage Alarm will be built using MQ4gas sensor and Blynk. You can monitor the gas level or leakage from your smartphone. This project is easy to build with minimum components. Lets see how we can build NodeMCU ESP8266 IoT based LPG Gas Leakage Alarm.
